Here is a clearer and more professional rephrasing of your text:

In this setup, we monitor CPU, memory, and network usage using a single program called `monitor.py`. When running this program, you can specify whether you want to monitor CPU, memory, or network usage. For network monitoring, you must also specify the network interface to be monitored.

Additionally, there are specialized scripts: `cm_monitor.py` for monitoring CPU and memory, and `n_monitor.py` for monitoring network usage specifically for a given program. You can use the `--help` command-line option with any of these scripts to see detailed usage instructions.

The testAuto script is designed to automate the process of conducting experiments. Currently, I have implemented the portion that verifies whether the setup is ready for experimentation. This functionality is handled by check.py, which ensures that all necessary services are running. It launches the client programs on both TCP and UDP client devices, and performs a sample experiment to verify that syslog is functioning correctly. This includes checking that all settings—such as conntrack_logger, the TCP server, and the client—are operating as expected, and that the log files are being properly generated and monitored
